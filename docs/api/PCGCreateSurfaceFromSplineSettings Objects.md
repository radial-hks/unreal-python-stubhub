## PCGCreateSurfaceFromSplineSettings Objects

```python
class PCGCreateSurfaceFromSplineSettings(PCGSettings)
```

Create an implicit surface for each given spline. The surface is given by the top-down 2D projection of the spline. Each spline must be closed.

Note that by default a low resolution polyline is used to represent the spline. If you observe that your interior samples are not sufficiently accurate,
you can resample the spline with a SplineSampler at your desired resolution, and convert the points back to a spline with the CreateSpline node.

**Editor Properties:** (see get_editor_property/set_editor_property)

- ``break_debugger`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If a debugger is attached, triggers a breakpoint inside IPCGElement::Execute(). Editor only. Transient.
- ``category`` (Text):  [Read-Write]
- ``debug`` (bool):  [Read-Write]
- ``debug_buffer_size`` (int32):  [Read-Write] Size (in number of floats) of the shader debug print buffer.
- ``debug_settings`` (PCGDebugVisualizationSettings):  [Read-Write]
- ``description`` (Text):  [Read-Write]
- ``determinism_settings`` (PCGDeterminismSettings):  [Read-Write]
- ``dump_cooked_hlsl`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Dump the cooked HLSL into the log after it is generated.
- ``dump_data_descriptions`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Dump the data descriptions of input/output pins to the log.
- ``enabled`` (bool):  [Read-Write]
- ``execute_on_gpu`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether this node should be executed on the GPU.
- ``expose_to_library`` (bool):  [Read-Write]
- ``print_shader_debug_values`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Enable use of 'WriteDebugValue(uint Index, float Value)' function in your kernel. Allows you to write float values to a buffer for logging on the CPU.
- ``seed`` (int32):  [Read-Write]
- ``use_seed`` (bool):  [Read-Write]
  deprecated: Implement the PCGSettings virtual UseSeed() override.
