## CameraRigProxyAsset Objects

```python
class CameraRigProxyAsset(Object)
```

A proxy for a camera rig asset.

This is useful for indicating that a camera rig should be activated in a camera director,
but without hard-referencing a particular camera rig. This way, that camera director can
be used by multiple cameras with their own camera rigs.
