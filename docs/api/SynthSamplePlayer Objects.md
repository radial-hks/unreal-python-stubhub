- ``auto_activate`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether the component is activated at creation or must be explicitly activated.
- ``bus_sends`` (Array[SoundSourceBusSendInfo]):  [Read-Write] This sound will send its audio output to this list of buses if there are bus instances playing after source effects are processed.
- ``can_ever_affect_navigation`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether this component can potentially influence navigation

  envelope value of sounds played with this audio component. Only used in audio mixer.
- ``envelope_follower_release_time`` (int32):  [Read-Write] The release time in milliseconds for the envelope follower. Delegate callbacks can be registered to get the
  envelope value of sounds played with this audio component. Only used in audio mixer.

- ``on_sample_playback_progress`` (OnSamplePlaybackProgress):  [Read-Write]
- ``override_attenuation`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Should the Attenuation Settings asset be used (false) or should the properties set directly on the component be used for attenuation properties
- ``physics_volume_changed_delegate`` (PhysicsVolumeChanged):  [Read-Write] Delegate that will be called when PhysicsVolume has been changed *
- ``pre_effect_bus_sends`` (Array[SoundSourceBusSendInfo]):  [Read-Write] This sound will send its audio output to this list of buses if there are bus instances playing before source effects are processed.
- ``primary_component_tick`` (ActorComponentTickFunction):  [Read-Write] Main tick function for the Component
- ``relative_location`` (Vector):  [Read-Write] Location of the component relative to its parent
- ``relative_rotation`` (Rotator):  [Read-Write] Rotation of the component relative to its parent
- ``relative_scale3d`` (Vector):  [Read-Write] Non-uniform scaling of the component relative to its parent.
  Note that scaling is always applied in local space (no shearing etc)
- ``replicate_using_registered_sub_object_list`` (bool):  [Read-Write] When true the replication system will only replicate the registered subobjects list
  When false the replication system will instead call the virtual ReplicateSubObjects() function where the subobjects need to be manually replicated.
- ``replicates`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Is this component currently replicating? Should the network code consider it for replication? Owning Actor must be replicating first!
- ``should_update_physics_volume`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether or not the cached PhysicsVolume this component overlaps should be updated when the component is moved.
  see: GetPhysicsVolume()
- ``sound_class`` (SoundClass):  [Read-Write] Sound class this sound belongs to
- ``sound_submix`` (SoundSubmixBase):  [Read-Write] Submix this sound belongs to
- ``sound_submix_sends`` (Array[SoundSubmixSendInfo]):  [Read-Write] An array of submix sends. Audio from this sound will send a portion of its audio to these effects.
- ``sound_wave`` (SoundWave):  [Read-Write]
- ``source_effect_chain`` (SoundEffectSourcePresetChain):  [Read-Write] The source effect chain to use for this sound.
- ``use_attach_parent_bound`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, this component uses its parents bounds when attached.
  This can be a significant optimization with many components attached together.
- ``visible`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether to completely draw the primitive; if false, the primitive is not drawn, does not cast a shadow.
