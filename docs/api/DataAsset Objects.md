## DataAsset Objects

```python
class DataAsset(Object)
```

Create a simple asset that stores data related to a particular system in an instance of this class.
Assets can be made in the Content Browser using any native class that inherits from this.
If you want data inheritance or a complicated hierarchy, Data Only Blueprint Classes should be created instead.
