## NeuralProfile Objects

```python
class NeuralProfile(Object)
```

This class represents assets that stores the neural network model data and the conversion from/to the model.

Neural network model profile typically consist of a neural network model data and the config of preprocessing/post-processing
of applying this neural network model.

**C++ Source:**
