## PrimaryDataAsset Objects

```python
class PrimaryDataAsset(DataAsset)
```

A DataAsset that implements GetPrimaryAssetId and has asset bundle support, which allows it to be manually loaded/unloaded from the AssetManager.
Instances of native subclasses can be created directly as Data Assets in the editor and will use the name of the native class as the PrimaryAssetType.
Or, blueprint subclasses can be created to add variables and then subclassed again by Data Only Blueprints that set those variables.
With blueprint subclasses, use Data Only Blueprints (and not Data Asset instances) to properly handle data inheritance and updating the parent class.

The PrimaryAssetType will be equal to the name of the first native class going up the hierarchy, or the highest level blueprint class.
IE, if you have UPrimaryDataAsset -> UParentNativeClass -> UChildNativeClass -> DataOnlyBlueprintClass the type will be ChildNativeClass.
Whereas if you have UPrimaryDataAsset -> ParentBlueprintClass -> DataOnlyBlueprintClass the type will be ParentBlueprintClass.
To change this behavior, override GetPrimaryAssetId in your native class or copy those functions into a different native base class.
