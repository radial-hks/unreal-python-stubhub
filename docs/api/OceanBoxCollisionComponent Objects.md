  note: Both this component and the other one must have GetGenerateOverlapEvents() set to true to generate overlap events.
  note: When receiving an overlap from another object's movement, the directions of 'Hit.Normal' and 'Hit.ImpactNormal' will be adjusted to indicate force from the other object against this object.

  note: For collisions during physics simulation to generate hit events, 'Simulation Generates Hit Events' must be enabled for this component.
  note: When receiving a hit from another object's movement, the directions of 'Hit.Normal' and 'Hit.ImpactNormal' will be adjusted to indicate force from the other object against this object.

  The material also needs to be set up to output to a virtual texture.

  see: MoveComponent()
- ``translucency_sort_distance_offset`` (float):  [Read-Write] Modified sort distance offset for translucent objects in world units.
  A positive number will move the sort distance further and a negative number will move the distance closer.

  Ignored if the object is not translucent.
  Warning: Adjusting this value will prevent the renderer from correctly sorting based on distance.  Only modify this value if you are certain it will not cause visual artifacts.
- ``translucency_sort_priority`` (int32):  [Read-Write] Translucent objects with a lower sort priority draw behind objects with a higher priority.
  Translucent objects with the same priority are rendered from back-to-front based on their bounds origin.
  This setting is also used to sort objects being drawn into a runtime virtual texture.

  Ignored if the object is not translucent.  The default priority is zero.
  Warning: This should never be set to a non-default value unless you know what you are doing, as it will prevent the renderer from sorting correctly.
  It is especially problematic on dynamic gameplay effects.
- ``treat_as_background_for_occlusion`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Treat this primitive as part of the background for occlusion purposes. This can be used as an optimization to reduce the cost of rendering skyboxes, large ground planes that are part of the vista, etc.
- ``use_as_occluder`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether to render the primitive in the depth only pass.
  This should generally be true for all objects, and let the renderer make decisions about whether to render objects in the depth only pass.
  todo: if any rendering features rely on a complete depth only pass, this variable needs to go away.
- ``use_attach_parent_bound`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, this component uses its parents bounds when attached.
  This can be a significant optimization with many components attached together.
- ``use_system_default_obstacle_area_class`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Uses FNavigationSystem::GetDefaultObstacleArea() by default instead of AreaClassOverride, bDynamicObstacle must be true to use this.
- ``virtual_texture_cull_mips`` (int8):  [Read-Write] Number of lower mips in the runtime virtual texture to skip for rendering this primitive.
  Larger values reduce the effective draw distance in the runtime virtual texture.
