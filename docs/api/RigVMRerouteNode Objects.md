## RigVMRerouteNode Objects

```python
class RigVMRerouteNode(RigVMNode)
```

A reroute node is used to visually improve the
data flow within a Graph. Reroutes are purely
cosmetic and have no impact on the resulting
VM whatsoever. Reroutes can furthermore be
displayed as full nodes or as small circles.
