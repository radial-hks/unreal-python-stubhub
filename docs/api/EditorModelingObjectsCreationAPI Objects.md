## EditorModelingObjectsCreationAPI Objects

```python
class EditorModelingObjectsCreationAPI(ModelingObjectsCreationAPI)
```

Implementation of UModelingObjectsCreationAPI suitable for use in UE Editor.
- CreateMeshObject() currently creates a StaticMesh Asset/Actor, a Volume Actor or a DynamicMesh Actor
- CreateTextureObject() currently creates a UTexture2D Asset
- CreateMaterialObject() currently creates a UMaterial Asset

This is intended to be registered in the ToolsContext ContextObjectStore.
Static utility functions ::Register() / ::Find() / ::Deregister() can be used to do this in a consistent way.

Several client-provided callbacks can be used to customize functionality (eg in Modeling Mode)
 - GetNewAssetPathNameCallback is called to determine an asset path. This can be used to do
   things like pop up an interactive path-selection dialog, use project-defined paths, etc
 - OnModelingMeshCreated is broadcast for each new created mesh object
 - OnModelingTextureCreated is broadcast for each new created texture object
 - OnModelingMaterialCreated is broadcast for each new created material object
