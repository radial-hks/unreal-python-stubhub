## MoviePipelineOutputData Objects

```python
class MoviePipelineOutputData(StructBase)
```

Contains information about the to-disk output generated by a movie pipeline. This structure is used both for per-shot work finished
callbacks and for the final render finished callback. When used as a per-shot callback ShotData will only have one entry (for the
shot that was just finished), and for the final render callback it will have data for all shots that managed to render. Can be empty
if the job failed to produce any files.

**C++ Source:**

- **Plugin**: MovieRenderPipeline
- **Module**: MovieRenderPipelineCore
- **File**: MovieRenderPipelineDataTypes.h

**Editor Properties:** (see get_editor_property/set_editor_property)

- ``graph_data`` (Array[MovieGraphRenderOutputData]):  [Read-Only] The file data for each shot that was rendered. If no files were written this will be empty. If this is from the per-shot work
  finished callback it will only have one entry (for the just finished shot). Will not include shots that did not get rendered
  due to the pipeline encountering an error.

  This will be empty when using the legacy Movie Pipeline Configurations. If a job is a legacy configuration, use ShotData instead, which has
  a similar layout but with different data types.
- ``job`` (MoviePipelineExecutorJob):  [Read-Only] Job the data is for. Job may still be in progress (if a shot callback) so be careful about modifying properties on it
  When using the Movie Render Graph this will point to the duplicated job created during execution.
- ``pipeline`` (MoviePipelineBase):  [Read-Only] The UMoviePipeline instance that generated this data. This is only provided as an id (in the event you were the one who created
  the UMoviePipeline instance. DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ON THIS (unless you know what you're doing)

  Provided here for backwards compatibility.
- ``shot_data`` (Array[MoviePipelineShotOutputData]):  [Read-Only] The file data for each shot that was rendered. If no files were written this will be empty. If this is from the per-shot work
  finished callback it will only have one entry (for the just finished shot). Will not include shots that did not get rendered
  due to the pipeline encountering an error.

  This will be empty when using the Movie Render Graph. If a job is a Movie Render Graph job, use GraphData instead, which has
  a similar layout but with different data types.
- ``success`` (bool):  [Read-Only] Did the job succeed, or was it canceled early due to an error (such as failure to write file to disk)?

#### __init__

```python
def __init__(pipeline: MoviePipelineBase = None,
             job: MoviePipelineExecutorJob = None,
             success: bool = False,
             shot_data: Array[MoviePipelineShotOutputData] = [],
             graph_data: Array[MovieGraphRenderOutputData] = []) -> None
```

<a id="unreal.MoviePipelineOutputData.pipeline"></a>

#### pipeline

```python
@property
def pipeline() -> MoviePipelineBase
```

(MoviePipelineBase):  [Read-Only] The UMoviePipeline instance that generated this data. This is only provided as an id (in the event you were the one who created
the UMoviePipeline instance. DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS ON THIS (unless you know what you're doing)

Provided here for backwards compatibility.

<a id="unreal.MoviePipelineOutputData.job"></a>

#### job

```python
@property
def job() -> MoviePipelineExecutorJob
```

(MoviePipelineExecutorJob):  [Read-Only] Job the data is for. Job may still be in progress (if a shot callback) so be careful about modifying properties on it
When using the Movie Render Graph this will point to the duplicated job created during execution.

<a id="unreal.MoviePipelineOutputData.success"></a>

#### success

```python
@property
def success() -> bool
```

(bool):  [Read-Only] Did the job succeed, or was it canceled early due to an error (such as failure to write file to disk)?

<a id="unreal.MoviePipelineOutputData.shot_data"></a>

#### shot_data

```python
@property
def shot_data() -> Array[MoviePipelineShotOutputData]
```

(Array[MoviePipelineShotOutputData]):  [Read-Only] The file data for each shot that was rendered. If no files were written this will be empty. If this is from the per-shot work
finished callback it will only have one entry (for the just finished shot). Will not include shots that did not get rendered
due to the pipeline encountering an error.

This will be empty when using the Movie Render Graph. If a job is a Movie Render Graph job, use GraphData instead, which has
a similar layout but with different data types.

#### graph_data

```python
@property
def graph_data() -> Array[MovieGraphRenderOutputData]
```

(Array[MovieGraphRenderOutputData]):  [Read-Only] The file data for each shot that was rendered. If no files were written this will be empty. If this is from the per-shot work
finished callback it will only have one entry (for the just finished shot). Will not include shots that did not get rendered
due to the pipeline encountering an error.

This will be empty when using the legacy Movie Pipeline Configurations. If a job is a legacy configuration, use ShotData instead, which has
a similar layout but with different data types.
