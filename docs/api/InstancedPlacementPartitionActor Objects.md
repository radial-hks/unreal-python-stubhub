## InstancedPlacementPartitionActor Objects

```python
class InstancedPlacementPartitionActor(ISMPartitionActor)
```

The base class used by any editor placement of instanced objects, which holds any relevant runtime data for the placed instances.

**C++ Source:**

- **Module**: Engine
- **File**: InstancedPlacementPartitionActor.h

**Editor Properties:** (see get_editor_property/set_editor_property)

- ``actor_guid`` (Guid):  [Read-Write] The GUID for this actor; this guid will be the same for actors from instanced streaming levels.
  see: ActorInstanceGuid, FActorInstanceGuidMapper
  note: Don't use VisibleAnywhere here to avoid getting the CPF_Edit flag and get this property reset when resetting to defaults. See FActorDetails::AddActorCategory and EditorUtilities::CopySingleProperty for details.
- ``actor_instance_guid`` (Guid):  [Read-Write] The instance GUID for this actor; this guid will be unique for actors from instanced streaming levels.
  see: ActorGuid
  note: This is not guaranteed to be valid during PostLoad, but safe to access from RegisterAllComponents.
- ``allow_tick_before_begin_play`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether we allow this Actor to tick before it receives the BeginPlay event.
  Normally we don't tick actors until after BeginPlay; this setting allows this behavior to be overridden.
  This Actor must be able to tick for this setting to be relevant.
- ``always_relevant`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Always relevant for network (overrides bOnlyRelevantToOwner).
- ``async_physics_tick_enabled`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether to use use the async physics tick with this actor.
- ``auto_destroy_when_finished`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true then destroy self when "finished", meaning all relevant components report that they are done and no timelines or timers are in flight.
- ``auto_receive_input`` (AutoReceiveInput):  [Read-Write] Automatically registers this actor to receive input from a player.
- ``block_input`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, all input on the stack below this actor will not be considered
- ``call_pre_replication`` (bool):  [Read-Write]
- ``call_pre_replication_for_replay`` (bool):  [Read-Write]
- ``can_be_damaged`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether this actor can take damage. Must be true for damage events (e.g. ReceiveDamage()) to be called.
  see: https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/damage-in-ue4
  see: TakeDamage(), ReceiveDamage()
- ``can_be_in_cluster`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, this actor can be put inside of a GC Cluster to improve Garbage Collection performance
- ``content_bundle_guid`` (Guid):  [Read-Write] The GUID for this actor's content bundle.
- ``custom_time_dilation`` (float):  [Read-Write] Allow each actor to run at a different time speed. The DeltaTime for a frame is multiplied by the global TimeDilation (in WorldSettings) and this CustomTimeDilation for this actor's tick.
- ``data_layer_assets`` (Array[DataLayerAsset]):  [Read-Write] There is currently an issue where if we allow property override of DataLayerAssets and it contains Private datalayers
  then it will always serialize a diff since those are outered to the instanced level and will get remapped differently between the Override instance and Archetype instance we are comparing against
- ``data_layers`` (Array[ActorDataLayer]):  [Read-Only] DataLayers the actor belongs to.
- ``default_update_overlaps_method_during_level_streaming`` (ActorUpdateOverlapsMethod):  [Read-Only] Default value taken from config file for this class when 'UseConfigDefault' is chosen for
  'UpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming'. This allows a default to be chosen per class in the matching config.
  For example, for Actor it could be specified in DefaultEngine.ini as:

  [/Script/Engine.Actor]
  DefaultUpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming = OnlyUpdateMovable

  Another subclass could set their default to something different, such as:

  [/Script/Engine.BlockingVolume]
  DefaultUpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming = NeverUpdate
  see: UpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming
- ``enable_auto_lod_generation`` (bool):  [Read-Write] Whether this actor should be considered or not during HLOD generation.

- ``find_camera_component_when_view_target`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, this actor should search for an owned camera component to view through when used as a view target.
- ``generate_overlap_events_during_level_streaming`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, this actor will generate overlap Begin/End events when spawned as part of level streaming, which includes initial level load.
  You might enable this is in the case where a streaming level loads around an actor and you want Begin/End overlap events to trigger.
  see: UpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming

  bounding box unless the Actor's class has overridden IsLevelBoundsRelevant
- ``remote_role`` (NetRole):  [Read-Only] Describes how much control the remote machine has over the actor.
- ``replay_rewindable`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, this actor will only be destroyed during scrubbing if the replay is set to a time before the actor existed.

  Note, this Actor must not be destroyed by gamecode, and RollbackViaDeletion may not be used.
- ``replicate_movement`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, replicate movement/location related properties.
  Actor must also be set to replicate.
  see: SetReplicates()
  see: https://docs.unrealengine.com/InteractiveExperiences/Networking/Actors
- ``replicate_using_registered_sub_object_list`` (bool):  [Read-Write] When true the replication system will only replicate the registered subobjects and the replicated actor components list
  When false the replication system will instead call the virtual ReplicateSubobjects() function where the subobjects and actor components need to be manually replicated.
- ``replicated_movement`` (RepMovement):  [Read-Write] Used for replication of our RootComponent's position and velocity
- ``replicates`` (bool):  [Read-Write] If true, this actor will replicate to remote machines
  see: SetReplicates()
- ``role`` (NetRole):  [Read-Only] Describes how much control the local machine has over the actor.
- ``root_component`` (SceneComponent):  [Read-Write] The component that defines the transform (location, rotation, scale) of this Actor in the world, all other components must be attached to this one somehow
- ``runtime_grid`` (Name):  [Read-Write] Determine in which partition grid this actor will be placed in the partition (if the world is partitioned).
  If None, the decision will be left to the partition.
- ``spawn_collision_handling_method`` (SpawnActorCollisionHandlingMethod):  [Read-Write] Controls how to handle spawning this actor in a situation where it's colliding with something else. "Default" means AlwaysSpawn here.
- ``sprite_scale`` (float):  [Read-Write] The scale to apply to any billboard components in editor builds (happens in any WITH_EDITOR build, including non-cooked games).
- ``tags`` (Array[Name]):  [Read-Write] Array of tags that can be used for grouping and categorizing.
- ``update_overlaps_method_during_level_streaming`` (ActorUpdateOverlapsMethod):  [Read-Write] Condition for calling UpdateOverlaps() to initialize overlap state when loaded in during level streaming.
  If set to 'UseConfigDefault', the default specified in ini (displayed in 'DefaultUpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming') will be used.
  If overlaps are not initialized, this actor and attached components will not have an initial state of what objects are touching it,
  and overlap events may only come in once one of those objects update overlaps themselves (for example when moving).
  However if an object touching it *does* initialize state, both objects will know about their touching state with each other.
  This can be a potentially large performance savings during level loading and streaming, and is safe if the object and others initially
  overlapping it do not need the overlap state because they will not trigger overlap notifications.

  Note that if 'bGenerateOverlapEventsDuringLevelStreaming' is true, overlaps are always updated in this case, but that flag
  determines whether the Begin/End overlap events are triggered.
